Once upon a time, in a land far away, there lived a wise old owl. 
The owl would tell stories to the forest animals every night, sharing his wisdom and lessons.
One day, a young fox approached and asked, "Can you teach me how to be wise like you?"
The owl looked down with kind eyes and said, "Wisdom comes from listening, learning, and helping others."
